In scraping the data through the get_umsi_function, I ran into trouble when some of the titles/positions included an "&".
In my cache, all instances of "&" are written as "&amp;".
I had to write additional code (128-134) in order to change every instance of "&amp;" to "&".

On a side note, I have defined the file encoding in line 34.

I was having trouble having 5 tweets return when I searched McGill University. 
This is because for my twitter account, THERE WERE NO 5 RESULTS FOR THE SEARCH, "McGill University."
When another tweet including the term "McGill University" was tweeted, my search results increased by 1 to include the tweet.

I have coded the project to so that the function get_five_tweets returns less than 5 tweets if 5 tweets for the searh term does not exist.
For instance, if 3 tweets are the result, the function returns 3 functions.



Thank you.
